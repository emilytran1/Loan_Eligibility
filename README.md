# Loan_Eligibility

# Project Overview
This project involves predicting loan eligibility based on applicant data. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation using classification algorithms.

# Dataset
The project uses two datasets:

loan-train.csv: Training dataset containing information about loan applicants, including features like income, loan amount, and credit history.
loan-test.csv: Test dataset used to make predictions about loan eligibility.
